of data, but not accessed frequently.

The connection to the MongoDB server, defaults to:

- MongoDB database name = 'openerp' (mongodb_name)
- MongoDB server host = 'localhost' (mongodb_host)

You can use your own connection parameters by adding to the OpenERP 
configuration file the keywords in brackets.

from mongodb_backend import osv_mongodb

class MongoDBStoredObject(osv_mongodb.osv_mongodb):
    '''Define here the object as usual'''

MongoDBStoredObject()
